### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m an AI engineer, newbie (but very enthusiastic) technical writer, and I also lead a group of ML engineers at work.

My main interests in AI are reinforcement learning followed by graph neural networks, but since I work pretty much with CV and NLP at work, you can ask me about it too.


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NLP architectures from scratch:
-  (Step by step guides will be available on Medium https://medium.com/@bscarleth.gtz)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to create my own Open-gym environments for RL scenarios.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Reinforcement Learning and AI for MED projects.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:  [@brenda_linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brenda-scarleth-gutierrez-torres-670524b0/)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

âš¡ Fun fact: I have two dogs at home, and have the hope of naming an AI architecture, project, or model after them sometime in the future.
